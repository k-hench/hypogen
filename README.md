The **R** package **hypogen** provides ressources for population genetic analysis based on the hamlet reference genome.

The genome was published in our **Inter-chromosomal coupling between vision and pigmentation genes during genomic divergence** in [*Nature Ecology & Evolotion*](https://www.nature.com/natecolevol/) (DOI: 10.1038/s41559-019-0814-5).

The original genome can be downloaded from the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_900610375.1) (project accession number PRJEB27858).

The annotation is also deposited at [dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pg8q56g).
